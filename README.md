FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title="also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> (previously known as Swagger) and <a href="https://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a>.

# FastAPI Tutorial

This is a simple example FastAPI application that pretends to be a bookstore.

# Deploying to AWS EC2

Log into your AWS account and create an EC2 instance (`t2.micro`), using the latest stable
Ubuntu Linux AMI.

[Amazon EC2 Getting Started](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/ec2/getting-started/) and run these commands to update the software repository and install
our dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip nginx
```

Clone the FastAPI server app (or create your `main.py` in Python).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RonierisonMaciel/fastapi.git
```

Add the FastAPI configuration to NGINX's folder. Create a file called `fastapi_nginx` (like the one in this repository).

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/fastapi_nginx
```

And put this config into the file (replace the IP address with your EC2 instance's public IP):

```
server {
    listen 80;   
    server_name <YOUR_EC2_IP>;    
    location / {        
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;    
    }
}
```

Start NGINX.

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

Start FastAPI.

```bash
cd fastapi
python3 -m uvicorn swapi.main:app
```

Update EC2 security-group settings for your instance to allow HTTP traffic to port 80.

Now when you visit your public IP of the instance, you should be able to access your API.
